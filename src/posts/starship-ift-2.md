## Launch summary
- All engines functional
- No debris or damage to launch pad
- Stage separation achieved
- Flight termination system stopped the second stage before it went into orbit

## Thoughts
It's pretty crazy that people complain about the termination of the booster, done by the flight termination system or not, when before SpaceX, all rockets were doomed to fall into the ocean or explode. Only after they proved reusability that people started to act like this, which is ridiculous because they are using this new paradigm as a base to attack the company and it's status as the GOAT¹ of spaceflight.

¹. Greatest Of All Time

SpaceX has inadvertently created the expectations and goal posts that it's detractors are using to bash it.
