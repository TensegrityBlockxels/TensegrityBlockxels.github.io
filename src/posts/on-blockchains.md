title: On blockchains
---
After doing research for a project, I came across the Byzantine Generals problem, permission vs permissionless networks (which really took me back to the cryptocurrency boom of 2021) and among other things, I realized that blockchains are a technical solution to the social problem of trust. My project, then, is based on federated design, similar to [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/). The protocol will have heuristics for determining good or bad behavior of linked servers, If good, the admin will receive a recommendation to assign _trust_ to that server. This will help sort out browsing systems for end users.
