title: Antarctica colonization vs Space colonization
---
Many make the point that, given the overall disinterest in colonizing the Antartic, space colonization is not going to be as prominent as envisioned. However consider that:
1. Antarctica, by the time that colonization became an option, was already understood as a delicate ecosystem, and that any disruption there had negative implications for the global climate.
2. In the UN, it was decided that it was the reserved patrimony of humankind.
3. The land didn't have any economic potential.
